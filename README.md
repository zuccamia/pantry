## Introduction
Pantry is a mobile web app that reduces household food waste by reminding you when your food will expire and offering recipes that use your expiring ingredients.

View the food in your home at a glance.

Save your favorite recipes and search for new ones by ingredient.

Take advantage of Pantry's LINE integration to easily manage your shopping list. 

Use the camera on your smartphone as a barcode scanner to instantly add new items to your digital Pantry.
